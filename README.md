### React context
- Used to pass data common to all componentes.
ex: change the theme, language translation. 

### Some other things to keep in mind:
- You can use react-lazy-load-image-component to lazy load images and add effects.
- Cookie consent ready with react-cookie-consent. 
- The project is fetching dummy data from [jsonplaceholder.typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

## Using this template
1. Fork it!
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. npm install the dependencies `<npm install >`
4. Run the project `<npm start>`
***

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
