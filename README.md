### React context
- Used to pass data common to all componentes.
ex: change the theme, language translation. 

### Some other things to keep in mind:
- You can use react-lazy-load-image-component to lazy load images and add effects.
- Cookie consent ready with react-cookie-consent. 
- The project is fetching dummy data from [jsonplaceholder.typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

## Using this template
1. Fork it!
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. npm install the dependencies `<npm install >`
4. Run the project `<npm start>`
***

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run test`

Runs the tests which have been written in the cypress folder.\
